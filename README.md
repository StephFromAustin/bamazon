# bamazon

Welcome to my bAmazon application! In this application we made a terminal like amazon store front. 

Technologies used were:
node.js
MySql
terminal 
inquirer
VSCode 
init -y

In the terminal a customer will be able to view products, the department the product is located, and the price. The customer can select given product and chose quantity desired. If the customer desires more than the quantity available the application will prompt the customer to choose another quantity amount.
